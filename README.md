# Blok Layout
![Blok][grid-screenshot]

Blok is a grid layout, that's very easy to use, and will save you tons of time. It's based on Flexible Box Layout Module (http://www.w3.org/TR/css3-flexbox/).

## Introduction
Blok is a layouting helper SASS/CSS library that you can easily include in your project and get started right away. It's similar to other grids like Bootstrap's or Foundation's,..etc but there are few major differences explained below.

## Blok Principles
1- There shouldn't be a fixed number of columns per row, you can have hundreds of columns per row if you want.

2- Layout grids should handle both horizontal and vertical layouts.

3- Making a column or all columns in a row center itself vertically in a row should be easy.

4- No columns gutters.

5- No floats.

6- No percentage width.
